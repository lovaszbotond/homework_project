# Labyrinth

## What is this project?  
This project is my homework project for my Software Engineering course at my university.
  
## Description
This project is basically a labyrinth game where you have to escape. However, there is a catch.
In the labyrinth there is a monster with you whose only goal is to catch you. To make things even worse,
for every step you take the monster takes two steps if it can. The monster prefers to move horizontally
if it can while getting closer to you. You can use this information to your advantage.
